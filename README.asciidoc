== Server

.The server is currently:
* Built with Grade.
* Written in Groovy.
* Implemented using Ratpack.
* Should follow https://github.com/libliotech/libs/blob/master/server/api.asciidoc[this] API spec.

=== Building

Using the Gradle wrapper:

 ./gradlew clean :server:build

=== Running

 ./gradlew run

This will start the server and bind to Ratpack's default port +5050+

To test the server you can run:

 noam@serenity:$ curl http://localhost:5050/hello

Which should result in:

 Hello Libs :)
